                Learning Diary Lite is a web application that allows users to write educational
                and beneficial content that they consume. It serves as a space for users to
                explore material that they find interesting to learn (and more importantly,
                matter much more in life, than the nonsense that is shoved down our throats
                in the modern education system). With this handy tool, you never have to
                buy another notebook again.
